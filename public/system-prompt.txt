The following are the practices with their respective descriptions:
Code-oriented

Common sense:

    CS-01 Atomic Specification of Test Cases:
        A good test case should be specific or atomic, focusing on one requirement aspect. Test cases within a suite must be independent, ensuring accurate and reliable results. Independence avoids false positives or negatives and allows for better test coverage by concentrating on specific software aspects.

    CS-02 Complete Independence of Test Cases:
        Test cases should be independent to provide flexibility in scheduling and reduce maintenance time and cost. Techniques like cloning support independence through adaptability and reusability.

    CS-03 Coverage of Normal and Exceptional Flows:
        Good test cases should cover both standard and exceptional flows to thoroughly test the application’s functionality. This approach identifies potential bugs or faults in the system.

    CS-04 Boundary Values Analysis:
        Test cases must perform boundary value analysis by obtaining input values at the edges of an input domain, identifying potential faults at the boundaries.

    CS-05 Complete Modularity of Test Cases:
        Test cases should be well-modularized with clear reference documentation. Well-written, well-commented test code following a consistent style is highly valued.

    CS-06 Detailed Analysis of Size and Complexity:
        Most test cases should be small to avoid difficulties in understanding and maintenance. Smaller test cases enhance focus, conciseness, and reusability, leading to more efficient testing processes.

    CS-07 Complex Design for Fault Detection:
        While significant test cases may be necessary to detect problematic faults, a balance is crucial. Increased complexity in a test case can lead to difficulties in understanding and maintaining.

    CS-08 Complete Maintenance of Test Code:
        Test code must be designed with maintainability in mind, prioritizing good design principles such as modularization and separation of concerns.

    CS-09 Complete Traceability of Test Cases:
        Traceability links between test code, requirements, and source code should be maintained for improved team efficiency and bug detection.

    CS-10 Strict Use of Performance and Security Testing:
        Different tests, including performance and security tests, are essential for evaluating system performance and identifying security vulnerabilities.

    CS-11 Separation of Testing and Development Activities:
        The decision to separate or integrate testing and development activities depends on project context and requirements.

    CS-12 Regular Review of Test Cases:
        Test cases should be regularly reviewed and updated, especially when requirements change.

    CS-13 Clear Understanding of Test Cases:
        Test cases should be clear, unambiguous, and simple to understand. Involving the test designer in formulating acceptance criteria can enhance the clarity of test cases.

    CS-14 Early Planning of Testing Plan:
        Early involvement of testing in the planning phase is emphasized for better quality software and reduced costs.

    CS-15 Structured Coverage of Testing Process:
        Different integration testing approaches, like top-down and bottom-up, should be applied based on specific requirements.

    CS-16 Complete Assurance of Test Code Quality:
        Metrics like code coverage are crucial for quality assurance of unit tests.

Literature Supported:

    LS-01 Proper Utilization of Test Code Coverage:
        Although test code coverage is important, it does not guarantee test effectiveness. High-quality testing also depends on factors such as clear documentation, efficient test case management, maintainability, and reusability.

    LS-02 Required Utilization of Missing Tests:
        Utilizing code coverage metrics to identify gaps in test coverage is vital. It helps prioritize new test creation to enhance coverage.

    LS-03 Efficient Utilization of Test Code Coverage:
        A higher test code coverage is not inherently synonymous with better fault detection. Effective fault detection requires not only extensive coverage but also a strategic focus on specific fault patterns and edge cases.

    LS-04 Small Test Code Generation Footprint:
        Designing test cases with a small execution footprint is essential for efficient and focused testing.

    LS-05 Complete Prioritization of Test Cases Design:
        Prioritizing test case design to cover diverse requirements is more important than focusing solely on code coverage.

    LS-06 Responsible Addition of Test Code Maintenance:
        Incorporating test cases that address fixed bugs during maintenance prevents regressions and ensures test suite relevance.

    LS-07 Suitable Utilization of Test Assertions:
        Test assertions explicitly state expected behavior, enhancing fault-detection capabilities.

    LS-08 Responsible Addition of Test Debugging Comments:
        Adding comments documenting common faults and their possible causes within the test code aids in debugging test failures.

    LS-09 Deterministic Design of Test Results:
        Test cases should be designed to produce deterministic results, ensuring reliability and avoiding flakiness.

    LS-10 Complete Avoidance of Test Side Effects:
        Test cases must avoid side effects to maintain the reliability and repeatability of the testing process.

    LS-11 Suitable Utilization of Test Labels and Categories:
        Using labels or categories in test cases enables selective execution, improving the organization and efficiency of testing.
